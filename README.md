# MEAN Stack Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to teacher members how to create a restful web api using stack applications. Our focus will be on MongoDB because of it's ability to handle large amounts of data and scale with our project as we progress. Express, Angular, and Node will be used for backend, fronend, and serverside processes in that order. However, there are other dependencies that will be used (jade, reactJS, etc.) occasionally. This workshop will not only teach the basics of MEAN stack applications but also teach students how to organize their development process using the SDLC. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get all applications and dependencies needed for every workshop. This will be updated if I introduce a new item 
during the classes. 

### Prerequisites

M.E.A.N. is an acronym that stands for MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS In order to create a RESTful web API we first need to
these items. Since the first meeting I've found an easy way to install everything. You will need to create a free Bitnami account to 
download the installation package. Please use the links below...

Please click the link that corresponds to you. This installation will install MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and NodeJs. It will also 
install git, php, python, and other dependecies that we will use occasionally. 

Great you are now caught up!
